During my doctoral studies, I had the privilege of working as a Graduate Student Instructor for Econ 134 (Macroeconomic Policy from the Great Depression To Today -- taught by Emi Nakamura), Econ 101B (Honors Intermediate Macroeconomics -- taught by Yuriy Gorodnichenko), and Econ 1 (Introduction to Economics -- taught by Martha Olney). In 2022, I received the Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) award, which is given to the top 10% of GSIs at UC Berkeley.
