I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at [UC Berkeley](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/) and a Research Fellow at the [Macro Policy Lab](https://www.macropolicylab.org/). I work on topics at the intersection of macro, public, and behavioral economics. I am particularly interested in questions of household finance like the ways households smooth out shocks to their income and wealth. Prior to coming to Berkeley, I worked as a pre-doctoral fellow at the [Opportunity Insights Lab](https://opportunityinsights.org/), and I hold an M.Sc. from Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin.

I am on the 2022/23 academic job market. You can find my CV [here](https://github.com/nickflamang/nickflamang.github.io/blob/306325c5694890e2cefa66c45ac9f4b344cfc8b0/_site/files/CV_Niklas_Flamang.pdf) and you can contact me at [nflamang[at]berkeley[dot]edu](mailto:nflamang@berkeley.edu).
