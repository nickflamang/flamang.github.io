I work on topics at the intersection of macro, public, and behavioral economics. Specifically, I am interested in questions of household finance like the ways households smooth out shocks to their income and wealth. Here, I am trying to understand to what extent observed behavior can be explained by standard mechanisms like liquidity constraints or shocks to lifetime income or whether we need deviations from classical models to understand households' smoothing behavior.
