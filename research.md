I am an empirical macroeconomist with a particular focus on questions of household finance. My primary research interest is in households’ consumption behavior: Why do so many households have high marginal propensities to consume; is households’ borrowing behavior close to optimal smoothing; how do households weather anticipated and unanticipated shocks to their income?
