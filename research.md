title: Research

I am a household finance economist with my work stretching from empirical macroeconomics to public finance. My primary research interest is in household behavior in light of changes to income or wealth: Do households shop more selectively when their income falls; what are the labor supply responses to temporary liquidity shocks for unemployed workers; why is financial distress so seasonal?
