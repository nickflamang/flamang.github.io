I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at [UC Berkeley](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/) and a Research Fellow at the [Macro Policy Lab](https://www.macropolicylab.org/). I work on topics at the intersection of macro, public, and behavioral economics. I am particularly interested in questions of household finance like the ways households smooth out shocks to their income and wealth. Prior to coming to Berkeley, I worked as a pre-doctoral fellow at the [Opportunity Insights Lab](https://opportunityinsights.org/), and I hold an M.Sc. from Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin. 

I am on the 2022/23 academic job market. You can find my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8jmjnbfrxfxqa2f/CV_Website.pdf?dl=0) and you can contact me [here](mailto:nflamang@berkeley.edu).
