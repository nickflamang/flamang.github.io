I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at [UC Berkeley](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/) and a Research Fellow at the [Macro Policy Lab](https://www.macropolicylab.org/). I work on questions of empirical macroeconomics and household finance. My research focuses on understanding households' consumption behavior in light of anticipated and unanticipated shocks to their income. 

This summer, I will be joining [Nova School of Business and Economics](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/finance) as an Assistant Professor of Finance.
