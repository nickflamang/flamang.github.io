I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at [Nova School of Business and Economics](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/finance). I hold a PhD in Economics from [UC Berkeley](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/), and I work on questions of empirical macroeconomics and household finance. My research focuses on understanding households' consumption behavior in light of anticipated and unanticipated shocks to their income.
